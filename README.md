## Contribution

Contribution is very welcome! Feel free to open an issue for bug reports, add new tags to the spreadsheet or even open a PR.

### Suggest new tags

Glyphfinder searches through 34.306 characters, the file containing the full list of characters including all tags is too big for GitHub (more than 200 MB). Google Spreadsheet can handle this huge data set very well. If you want to suggest new tags, feel free to add them here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xdlg_pR3jSlTunmcmgZI70ZAQu7N4yoJFcL4Ssn6uJI/edit#gid=1187968163

#### Project setup

Feel free to clone the project and fiddle around with our code. You need Node and Yarn, and ‚Äî that‚Äôs special for this project ‚Äì need to generate the list of characters from a Google Spreadsheet.

```
yarn install
yarn generate
```

#### Run the development build

To start the development version of the app run the start script. The app will open and you‚Äôll be able to use it right-away. Changes to the code will be hot loaded.

```
yarn start
```

#### Lint and fix files

If you plan to send a PR with changes, run the lint process to fix code style issues:

```
yarn lint
```

## Builds

Don‚Äôt try to build the app, you won‚Äôt be able to code sign and/or notarize the app without a developer certificate. We‚Äôre running the build process manually and publish new versions on the website: https://www.glyphfinder.com

### Build the macOS version

Don‚Äôt do this at home. It won‚Äôt work without all the certificates and credentials. Hopefully this is helpful to other app developers though.

1. Bump version in /package.json
2. Fill out the .env
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Build the macOS version: `yarn run electron:build:mac`
5. Put the notarized version in the Zip file: `yarn run fix:build:mac`
6. Manually upload `Glyphfinder-*.dmg`, `Glyphfinder-*.dmg.blockmap`, `Glyphfinder-*.zip` and `latest-mac.yml` (find them in dist_electron) to the DigitalOcean space.
7. Manually upload the `Glyphfinder-*.dmg` to Gumroad.
8. Update the download links in `ueberdosis/glyphfinder-landingpage`.
9. Respond to suggestions on https://feedback.glyphfinder.com.
10. Tweet about the update. üê§

### New Release for SetApp

1. Jump to the SetApp Node.js wrapper: `cd setapp-nodejs-wrapper`
2. Install all dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Build the Node.js wrapper: `yarn build`
4. Jump back to the root folder: `cd ../`
5. Actually build the SetApp version: `yarn setapp:build`
6. Fix the Zip file: `yarn fix:build:mac`
7. Manually upload `dist_electron/Glyphfinder-*.dmg` to SetApp (https://developer.setapp.com/).
